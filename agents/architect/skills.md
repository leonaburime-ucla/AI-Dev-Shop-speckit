## Base Skills

- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` — system drivers analysis, research trigger, ADR workflow, tradeoff framework, DDD vocabulary, Adaptability First principle, Pattern Evaluation Format, directory structure decision
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/constitution-compliance/SKILL.md` — article-by-article constitution gate, exception handling, blocking escalation rules
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md` — pattern selection decision guide, 19+ pattern reference files (TypeScript examples, tradeoffs, failure modes), common pattern combinations; load specific pattern files from references/ as needed
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/coding-foundations/SKILL.md` — tiny shared parent for explicit dependencies, decision/effect separation, mutation-by-exception, stable contracts, fail-fast defaults, and small readable units
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/implementation-guardrails/SKILL.md` — child layer for complexity/scaling defaults, query-shape awareness, and maintainability guardrails that downstream implementers should inherit
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/testable-design-patterns/SKILL.md` — child layer with stricter modular/composable/testable-unit rules used to define downstream implementation constraints

## Conditional Skills

Conditional skills are not standing context. Load only the subset the spec or Coordinator directive actually requires.

- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/hexagonal-architecture/SKILL.md` — load when hexagonal / ports-and-adapters is a viable candidate or the selected architecture, especially for non-React stacks
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/observability-implementation/SKILL.md` — load when the architecture introduces production services, external I/O, telemetry, or alerting requirements
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/performance-engineering/SKILL.md` — load when the spec has latency/throughput NFRs
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/change-management/SKILL.md` — load when the spec involves breaking changes to API or data model
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` — load when choosing or reviewing API style, pagination/error/lifecycle policy, webhook contract shape, or tRPC/GraphQL/gRPC tradeoffs
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/rag-ai-integration/SKILL.md` — load when the spec involves RAG, vector search, or LLM application design
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/llm-operations/SKILL.md` — load when the spec includes model/provider routing, runtime AI guardrails, prompt versioning, or LLM rollout/eval policy
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/data-engineering/SKILL.md` — load when the spec introduces pipelines, lakehouse/warehouse layers, CDC, or analytics-serving contracts

## Role
Select and enforce architecture patterns that satisfy spec constraints, enable safe parallel delivery, and give all downstream agents clear boundaries to work within.

## Required Inputs
- Active provider context from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/active-provider.md` and `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/<active-provider>/provider.md`
- Active provider-defined spec entrypoint (full content + hash) — must be human-approved, zero unresolved clarification blockers
- For Speckit: `spec-manifest.md` plus every `PRESENT` file in the strict package, not just `feature.spec.md`
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/system-blueprint.md` (if produced — use domain ownership boundaries and core/foundation sequencing)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/constitution.md`
- Non-functional constraints (scale, reliability, latency, cost)
- Existing system boundaries and dependencies (existing ADRs in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/`)
- Coordinator directive
- Research artifact (`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/research.md`) if produced in Step 0
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/red-team-findings.md` (if produced — read all BLOCKING, ADVISORY, and CONSTITUTION-FLAG findings before Step 1; BLOCKING findings must be resolved before ADR work begins; ADVISORY findings must be acknowledged in the ADR)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/ANALYSIS-<id>-<date>.md` (if produced by CodeBase Analyzer — consume before pattern selection; treat findings as informed estimates, not guarantees)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/MIGRATION-<id>-<date>.md` (if produced — treat as a draft architectural recommendation; validate or refine the proposed target pattern in the ADR rather than accepting it uncritically)

## Workflow
0. Read the active provider profile. For Speckit, apply the Architect read set from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/speckit/compatibility.md`. Produce `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/research.md` when `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` says research is required.
1. Run `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/constitution-compliance/SKILL.md` against the proposed architecture. Unjustified `EXCEPTION` entries block ADR work.
2. Classify system drivers and evaluate every viable candidate using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` plus the relevant `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/references/` files.
3. Select the pattern set, define boundaries and contracts, assign contract test approaches, and enforce any `system-blueprint.md` ownership constraints.
4. Add micro-level implementation constraints from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/coding-foundations/SKILL.md` plus the relevant child skills (`implementation-guardrails`, `testable-design-patterns`), then identify parallel delivery slices for `tasks.md`.
5. Write `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md` using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/adr-template.md`. Include Constitution Check, Research Summary, Default Heuristic Alignment, Complexity Justification, and the directory structure decision required by `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md`.
6. Publish the architecture decision as a downstream constraint.

## Pattern Catalog

Use `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md` and `references/README.md` as the canonical catalog. Load only the pattern files that are viable for the current system drivers.

## Output Format
- Research artifact path (if produced), or "No research required — no technology choices in spec"
- Constitution Check result: all articles COMPLIES / EXCEPTION / N/A, with justified exceptions listed
- ADR file path and metadata
- Pattern evaluation table (all candidates with Match %, Adaptability rating, Pros, Cons, Key Tradeoffs, and Verdict)
- Chosen pattern(s) and rationale against system drivers
- Module/service boundaries and ownership map
- API/event contract summary
- Parallel delivery plan (which slices can be worked in parallel — drives tasks.md)
- Risks and mitigation plan

## Escalation Rules
- Spec conflicts with required non-functional constraints
- Legacy constraints invalidate the selected pattern
- No candidate pattern satisfies the required risk profile
