# Design Patterns Library

19+ production architecture patterns with TypeScript examples, tradeoffs, testing guidance, and failure modes. Load the specific pattern file(s) relevant to the current decision — do not load all at once.

## Pattern Selection Decision Guide

## Common Pattern Combinations

**Event-driven modular monolith** (recommended starting point for most products):
`modular-monolith` + `event-driven-architecture` + `reliability-patterns` (Outbox)

**Audit-ready enterprise system**:
`clean-architecture` + `cqrs` + `event-sourcing`

**High-scale distributed system**:
`microservices` + `event-driven-architecture` + `reliability-patterns` + `resilience-patterns` + `api-patterns`

**Legacy migration path**:
`strangler-fig` → `modular-monolith` → `microservices` (if needed)
