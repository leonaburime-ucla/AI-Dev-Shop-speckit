# Superpowers Dispatching Parallel Agents

Split independent work into parallel tracks only when independence is real.

## Execution

- Group the work into independent domains.
- Confirm the domains do not require shared state or ordered execution.
- Prepare one focused task per domain with scope, goal, constraints, and expected output.
- Dispatch the work in parallel.
- Review the returned outputs for overlap or conflict.
- Re-run the integration check or full verification after combining the results.

## Guardrails

- Do not parallelize related failures just to go faster.
- Do not dispatch multiple agents into the same files without explicit coordination.
- If independence is unclear, investigate first instead of parallelizing blindly.
- If conflicts appear on return, resolve them before claiming the parallel split was valid.

## Output

- domain split rationale
- per-domain task prompts
- conflict check result
- combined verification result

## Reference

- Preconditions:
  - at least two meaningful work items exist
  - the work can be isolated without shared-state conflicts
- Decision rule:
  - parallelize only when fixing one domain is unlikely to fix or change the others
  - keep work sequential when ownership, state, or edited files overlap
