# Skill: System Blueprint

This skill produces a macro-level architecture planning artifact before detailed feature specs.

## Purpose

Provide a high-level system layout so Spec Agent knows what to spec and at what granularity.

This stage exists to prevent downstream spec drift: if specs are written before macro boundaries are clear, they often encode the wrong granularity, assumptions, and ownership model. That causes rework in Architect/TDD/Programmer later.

- This is problem-space and system-shape planning.
- This is not a feature-level ADR.
- This does not make binding micro-level implementation decisions.

## When to Use

Run before Spec when one or more are true:

- Multi-domain system or unclear bounded contexts.
- Unclear ownership of data or integration boundaries.
- Expected parallel team/slice delivery.
- Greenfield product with uncertain system decomposition.

## Inputs

- Product vision / vibe output / discovery notes.
- Constraints: compliance, latency, reliability, budget, timeline.
- Existing architecture context (if extending an existing system).

## Skill Loading Priority

1. Primary: this skill (`system-blueprint`) controls process and artifact shape.
2. Secondary (always): `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md` for macro architecture option language and tradeoff framing.
3. Secondary (always): `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` for system-driver framing (without producing ADR decisions here).
4. Conditional tertiary skills (load only when needed):
   - `sql-data-modeling` for ambiguous data ownership boundaries
   - `api-contracts` for integration-heavy domain boundaries
   - `change-management` for legacy migration planning
   - `performance-engineering` for strict NFR-driven topology decisions

## Exploration Requirement (mandatory)

Before finalizing the blueprint, run a short exploratory tradeoff discussion with the human:

1. Present 2-3 plausible macro stack directions.
2. Explain tradeoffs in plain language (delivery speed, complexity, scalability, operations, cost, team fit).
3. Ask what the user prefers or wants to avoid.
4. Reflect the chosen direction in the blueprint with rationale.

This stage should help the user learn options and choose intentionally, not receive a one-shot static output.

## Required Output

Write one artifact using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/templates/system-blueprint-template.md` to:

`<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<project-or-feature>/system-blueprint.md`

The output must include:

1. Macro components/domains and responsibilities.
2. Ownership boundaries and integration map.
3. High-level runtime/data topology.
4. Explicit risks and unknowns.
5. A required `Core/Foundation` spec package at `P0` (shared shell/primitives that block parallel slices).
6. Critical cross-domain user journeys for QA/E2E handoff.
7. Spec decomposition plan (what spec packages to write next).
8. Dependency-aware sequencing plan so parallel slices are only used where dependencies permit.

## Spec Decomposition Policy

Default to **vertical/domain slicing** for decomposition.

- Preferred: domain-oriented spec packages (for example `auth-domain`, `checkout-domain`, `billing-domain`) that each own their relevant API/state/UI boundaries.
- Avoid horizontal decomposition (`frontend-only`, `api-only`, `database-only`) unless there is a clear, documented reason.
- If horizontal slicing is chosen, include explicit justification and expected coordination overhead in the blueprint risks section.
- Always define a `Core/Foundation` package at `P0`; domain slices must depend on it before parallel execution.
- If a slice depends on another slice's schema/API/event contract, it cannot run in the same parallel wave. Record the dependency in `Depends on` and place it in a later phase.
- If a slice needs a foreign key to another domain-owned table, the owner domain must be implemented first; the dependent slice must be sequenced after it.

## Guardrails

- Do not produce a feature-level ADR.
- Do not lock low-level implementation patterns.
- Keep stack direction non-binding unless a hard constraint already exists.
- `Core/Foundation` (`P0`) is a thin bootstrap layer only: shell/runtime primitives/shared clients/CI harness. Do not place feature-specific business logic or feature-owned tables in `P0`.
- Use `[OWNERSHIP UNCLEAR]` markers where needed; unresolved markers block Spec decomposition approval.
- Include `Critical User Journeys (Cross-Domain)` so QA/E2E can validate slice convergence end to end.

## Handoff Contract

- Inputs used
- Blueprint summary
- Risks/open unknowns
- Recommended next assignee: Spec Agent
