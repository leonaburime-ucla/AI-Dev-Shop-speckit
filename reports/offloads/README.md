# Offloads

Use this folder for large logs, diffs, traces, JSON blobs, and other artifacts that should not stay inline in chat or handoff text.

If an offload is only for local iteration and should not be kept in git, prefer `.local-artifacts/` instead of `reports/offloads/`.

Use `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/context-offloading.md` as the rule set and `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/templates/context-offload-template.md` as the default markdown format.

Suggested layout:

```text
reports/offloads/
  <workstream>/
    <timestamp>-<slug>.md
    <timestamp>-<slug>.txt
```

Feature-bound offloads can also live under `reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/offloads/` when the evidence belongs tightly to one feature run.
