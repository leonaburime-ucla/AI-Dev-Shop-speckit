# AI Dev Shop (speckit edition) — Todo

Paradigms and improvements to research, document, and wire into the pipeline.
All items are documentation/agent-instruction work — no code required unless noted.

Items marked **[PARTIAL]** have foundational work already in this repo.

## Quick Status Snapshot

- AGENTS.md Map Reduction: **DONE / MONITORED** (root map was slimmed to the safer range and detail moved into local quickstart/index docs; keep watching for re-expansion)
- Observer Agent Operational Cadence: **DONE / MONITORED** (cadence is now explicit in Observer, Coordinator, and workflow docs; keep it aligned as the pipeline evolves)
- Git Branching and PR Strategy: **OPEN**
- Multi-LLM Consensus Modes and Guardrails: **OPEN / PARTIAL** (consensus + preflight exists; strict model/version normalization still open)
- Protocol Split: MCP + A2A: **OPEN**
- Spec-Kit Command Contract Parity: **OPEN / PARTIAL** (command templates exist; frontmatter contracts still missing)

## De-Noise and Effectiveness

### AGENTS.md Map Reduction **[DONE / MONITORED]**
**What it is:** Shrink `AGENTS.md` into a tighter runtime map so the root instruction surface routes agents instead of re-explaining the whole framework.
**Current state:** Detailed startup/invocation/checkpoint content now lives in `framework/operations/pipeline-quickstart.md`, and the full agent roster now lives in `framework/routing/agent-index.md`. `AGENTS.md` remains the runtime map and startup contract and is back under the safer size target.
**What to add next:**
- Keep startup/mode/routing semantics at the root and move deeper operating detail into linked canonical docs.
- Remove repeated explanations that already live in `agents/`, `framework/workflows/`, `skills/`, or `harness-engineering/`.
- Re-run the doc-garden audit after the reduction and treat the root-file line count as a tracked harness metric.

### Context De-Noise Hardening
**What it is:** Reduce instruction noise and improve execution reliability by moving guardrails out of prose and into enforceable structure.
**Current state:** **Framework complete** in `maintainers/skill-md-format/` (standards, gates, tracker, failure matrix, overlays).
**Scope guardrail:** Current rollout covers `skills/vercel-*` and imported `skills/superpowers-*`; expand further only with explicit human approval.
**What to add next:**
- Skill transformation rollout: rewrite skills in phases using the new format (`Execution` / `Guardrails` / `Output` / `Reference`).
- Source preservation: keep existing long-form or imported source skills as canonical references while overlays/new versions are validated.
- Naming convention for rollout: preserve source docs as `ORIGINAL.md`; keep `SKILL.md` as AI/LLM execution-optimized; allow an optional root `README.md` for layout or usage notes; use `references/` for examples, active support docs, and preserved support-source files.
- Comparison workflow: for each rewritten skill, keep side-by-side diff notes and acceptance checks before promotion.

**Note:** Skill-MD-Format framework is complete, but the transformation still needs to be applied across the `skills/` folder in controlled rollout phases.
**Note:** `agents/*/skills.md` should be transformed in a second phase after `skills/` rollout is validated.
**Rollout safety gates:**
- Keep old or imported source files as `ORIGINAL.md` while validating new execution-format `SKILL.md`.
- Require a side-by-side promotion checklist (non-negotiable gates, routing correctness, handoff compatibility) before replacement.
- Roll out by agent cluster with pilot validation before broad replacement.

## External OSS Intake

### Code Report Video Intake Queue
**Source video:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn-gtHDsaPY`
**What it is:** Curated list of outside open-source agent/tooling repos mentioned in a March 12, 2026 Code Report video that are worth evaluating for future adoption.
**Why it matters:** These projects may improve agent staffing, prompt evaluation, context management, UI quality, forecasting, and model control. They should be reviewed systematically instead of getting installed ad hoc.
**Current state:** `agency-agents` has already been downloaded for review. Several other repo names came from auto-transcript text and need exact repo confirmation before installation.
**What to add next:**
- Create a lightweight intake checklist for external repos: exact repo URL, license, maintenance status, install method, security risk, overlap with current toolkit, and likely integration point.
- Separate `adopt soon`, `learn from only`, and `skip` outcomes after review so the repo folder does not become a dumping ground.
- Capture findings in a dedicated external-repos evaluation doc once the review pass starts.

**Review queue:**
- `agency-agents`
  - Why it is useful: broad agent-role starter kit that can accelerate experimentation with specialist personas and startup-like multi-agent staffing patterns.
  - Likely value here: role ideas, agent templates, and prompt structure comparisons against this toolkit's current agent set.
- `squad`
  - Why it is useful: multi-agent team runtime with persistent in-repo agent state, routing, orchestration logs, skills, templates, and sample projects.
  - Likely value here: go through the repo's projects/samples/templates and extract anything useful for coordinator routing, persistent agent memory, context hygiene, observability, and team bootstrap patterns.
- `promptfoo` (transcript said "Prompt Fu")
  - Why it is useful: prompt testing and evaluation framework for model/prompt comparisons, regressions, and adversarial red-team checks.
  - Likely value here: could strengthen prompt, rubric, and red-team validation workflows for agent prompts and user-facing AI features.
- `Mirofish` / `Mirrorish` / `Micro Fish` (exact repo name to confirm from transcript)
  - Why it is useful: described as a multi-agent prediction engine that ingests trend/news data and simulates agent discussion around it.
  - Likely value here: idea source for trend analysis, market-sensing agents, or multi-agent forecasting patterns.
- `Impeccable` (exact repo name to confirm from transcript)
  - Why it is useful: frontend-design-oriented command/skill set focused on simplifying and improving AI-generated UI.
  - Likely value here: possible source material for VibeCoder, UX/UI Designer, or frontend quality skills, especially around simplification and visual polish.
- `Open Viking` (exact repo name to confirm from transcript)
  - Why it is useful: described as an AI-agent memory/context database organized around filesystem-based resources, skills, and tiered loading.
  - Likely value here: directly relevant to context hygiene, tiered loading, token reduction, and long-term memory organization for agents.
- `Heretic` (exact repo name and safety posture to confirm before any install)
  - Why it is useful: described as a tool for removing model guardrails via "obliteration".
  - Likely value here: mostly research value around model-control techniques; high safety/governance review required before touching it.
- `Nano Chat` / `nanochat` (exact repo name to confirm from transcript)
  - Why it is useful: end-to-end small-LLM training pipeline including tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, evaluation, and UI.
  - Likely value here: useful for learning the full LLM stack and evaluating whether a small controllable local model could support narrow internal tasks.

**Do not prioritize from this video:**
- `Recall AI`
  - Sponsor mention, not part of the open-source install queue.

## Pipeline Gaps

### Specialized Harness Follow-Ons From Video **[OPEN]**
**Source video:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2K81s0OQto`
**What it is:** Follow-up ideas from a harness-engineering video focused on specialized multi-stage business workflows, deterministic rails, subagents, observability, and checkpointed execution.
**Why it matters:** Most repo-level harness work is now in place, but these items push the framework further toward specialized downstream harnesses for compliance, legal, financial, and other long-running business processes.
**What to add:**
- Stage-output schema enforcement: add stricter machine-validated output contracts for multi-stage handoffs instead of relying only on markdown structure and prose rules.
- Model-tier routing policy: document when to use stronger orchestrator models versus cheaper narrower subagents, including cost/quality tradeoff guidance.
- Phase-checkpoint template for downstream harnesses: require each major phase to write resumable checkpoint artifacts so long-running workflows can restart from phase `N` instead of from scratch.
- Specialized non-code validation-loop templates: add downstream templates for things like clause-vs-playbook checks, fact-check loops, and rule-based business validation beyond software testing.
- Fixed-plan vs dynamic-plan design guidance: document when a workflow should stay on deterministic fixed rails versus when dynamic replanning is acceptable.
- Tool-approval patterns for risky actions: add stronger downstream guidance for actions that should always require explicit human approval before write/push/send/publish behavior.
- Observability and trace design for specialized harnesses: define what a downstream harness should log about phase timing, retries, subagent activity, and validation outcomes without bloating the main context.

### React Component Testing Policy
**What it is:** UI testing is often skipped by LLMs. Need a strict policy enforcing React component test creation.
**Current state:** Added to `harness-engineering/quality/react-component-testing-policy.md`.
**What to add:** Enforce the policy across TDD and Programmer routing. Update skill definition files and evaluation checklists.

### Debug Playbook
**What it is:** Agents need a structured debug loop (reproduce, isolate, instrument, hypothesize, fix) to prevent thrashing.
**Current state:** Added to `harness-engineering/quality/debug-playbook.md`.
**What to add:** Enforce trace requirements and escalation rules across Programmer and QA roles.

### Observer Agent Operational Cadence
**What it is:** The Observer role and output format are well-defined but its trigger is not. Currently it "runs alongside" the pipeline with no specified cadence — making it easy to never dispatch in practice.
**Current state:** **[PARTIAL]** Observer behavior is documented in multiple places (`framework/workflows/multi-agent-pipeline.md`, scorecard docs), but Coordinator dispatch trigger rules are still not explicit.
**What to add:**
- Define trigger conditions in `agents/coordinator/skills.md`: dispatch Observer after every 3rd feature completion, after any convergence escalation, and on explicit Coordinator request
- Define what "weekly pattern report" means: manual trigger via slash command or Coordinator initiates after N features
- Add Observer dispatch to the Coordinator's post-Done workflow

### Git Branching and PR Strategy
**What it is:** The pipeline produces merge-ready code but says nothing about git workflow — feature branches, PR naming, review process, or merge strategy. The human is left to figure this out.
**Current state:** Still valid gap (no canonical branching/PR policy in coordinator workflow docs).
**What to add:**
- Recommended branch naming convention per feature: `feature/<SPEC-ID>-<feature-name>`
- PR description template that references spec hash, ADR path, and security sign-off status
- Coordinator guidance: when to create a branch (at TDD dispatch), when to signal PR-ready (at Done State)
- Note on merge strategy trade-offs (squash vs merge commit vs rebase) relative to spec traceability

### Testability Anti-Pattern Reporting
**What it is:** Ensure code anti-patterns that make testing hard are consistently surfaced to humans during implementation and review.
**Current state:** Catalog added in quality docs; enforcement across rewrite/rollout flow still pending.
**What to add:**
- Use `harness-engineering/quality/testability-antipatterns.md` as the canonical catalog.
- Require anti-pattern findings to be reported in handoff summaries with location, impact, and remediation route.
- Treat repeated unresolved anti-patterns as escalation candidates instead of silently continuing.

### Programmer Ambient Fast-Feedback Testing
**What it is:** Give Programmer immediate test breakage feedback during implementation without turning TestRunner into a continuous heavy agent.
**Current state:** Concept agreed in review discussions; not implemented.
**What to add (policy/docs only for now):**
- Require Programmer to run a fast local watcher during implementation (unit tests, plus optional small changed-file integration subset).
- Do not stream raw watcher logs into agent context; use signal-based summaries only.
- Define stable-failure alert criteria explicitly: only alert after debounce (10-20s) and 2 consecutive failing runs.
- Add anti-noise rules: alert budget (max N per interval), changed-file scope filtering, and compact payloads only (test id, short error, first failing frame).
- Define recovery-state behavior explicitly: after first alert, suppress repeat alerts for that same failure until it returns green; alert again only on future green -> failing regression.
- Preserve TestRunner as the formal gate for full suites, coverage profile checks, spec-hash validation, and certification artifact generation.
- Document this split in `agents/programmer/skills.md` and coordination docs; defer any scripting/automation until a later phase.

## Consensus Orchestration

### Multi-LLM Consensus Modes and Guardrails **[PARTIAL]**
**What it is:** `/consensus` and `skills/swarm-consensus/SKILL.md` exist, but they need stronger orchestration rules for architecture/data-modeling debates and reproducible runs with explicit mode control.
**Current state:** Core orchestration flow is implemented; this section now tracks only remaining gaps.
**Known issue:** Consensus runs can still misreport exact peer model/version identifiers in some environments; preflight/version capture needs stricter normalization and verification.
**What to add:**
- Normalize and verify peer model/version reporting across CLI outputs so preflight and reports always show accurate model IDs and versions.

---

## Interoperability

### Protocol Split: MCP + A2A
**What it is:** Two distinct integration patterns for extending the pipeline.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Tool and resource provisioning standard. Already the de-facto standard for connecting agents to external tools/data.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent, Google):** Protocol for agent-to-agent collaboration across systems/orgs. Still early — limited adoption as of early 2026.
**Why it matters:** MCP hardening is practical now. A2A is worth tracking but not worth building to yet.
**What to add:**
- `interop/` docs folder
- MCP integration guide — how to add MCP tools to each agent role, what permissions each role needs, security surface
- External Agent Gateway role definition — a lightweight broker agent that validates incoming A2A requests before they touch the pipeline
- A2A watch notes — revisit when adoption signal is clearer
**Defer:** Full A2A implementation until protocol stabilizes

## Polish

### Spec-Kit Command Contract Parity **[PARTIAL]**
**What it is:** Command files (`.claude/commands/`) currently lack machine-readable frontmatter. Spec-kit's command format includes `handoffs:` and `scripts:` fields that enable automated contract validation — e.g., checking that `/plan` references an approved spec before executing.
**Current state:** Command files exist in `framework/slash-commands/` (including `spec`, `clarify`, `plan`, `tasks`, `implement`, `review`, `consensus`, `agent`). Frontmatter contracts are still not present.
**What to add:**
- Frontmatter schema for command files — `description`, `requires`, `handoffs`, `produces`, and optional `mode`
- Update all command files in `framework/slash-commands/` to include frontmatter
- Coordinator skills update — teach it to validate command preconditions against frontmatter `requires` fields before dispatch
**References:** github/spec-kit command format (`github-spec-kit/framework/templates/commands/specify.md`)

---

### System Design Skill Coverage Hardening **[PARTIAL]**
**What it is:** The new `skills/system-design/` package exists, but it is still stronger on high-level topology and generic distributed-systems framing than on correctness, operational sharp edges, and security-depth topics.
**Current state:** **[PARTIAL]** Root skill plus references are in place; coverage is good enough to start, but not yet comprehensive against the full recurring system-design checklist.
**What to add:**
- Add reference coverage for hot keys / hot rows
- Add reference coverage for precomputation
- Add reference coverage for batching
- Deepen async processing guidance
- Add explicit idempotency guidance
- Add explicit deduplication guidance
- Add transaction tradeoff guidance
- Add concurrency issue patterns and failure modes
- Add health check guidance
- Add graceful degradation patterns
- Deepen authn/authz treatment
- Deepen secrets-management treatment
- Deepen rate-limiting treatment
- Add abuse-detection coverage

## Notes

- None of these require Python or code — all are markdown documentation, agent instruction files, and schema definitions
- A2A: monitor but don't build to yet
- Items marked [PARTIAL] have a head start from the speckit integration already done in this repo
