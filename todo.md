# AI Dev Shop (speckit edition) — Todo

Paradigms and improvements to research, document, and wire into the pipeline.
All items are documentation/agent-instruction work — no code required unless noted.

Items marked **[PARTIAL]** have foundational work already in this repo.

## Priority 3 — Interoperability

### Protocol Split: MCP + A2A
**What it is:** Two distinct integration patterns for extending the pipeline.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Tool and resource provisioning standard. Already the de-facto standard for connecting agents to external tools/data.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent, Google):** Protocol for agent-to-agent collaboration across systems/orgs. Still early — limited adoption as of early 2026.
**Why it matters:** MCP hardening is practical now. A2A is worth tracking but not worth building to yet.
**What to add:**
- `interop/` docs folder
- MCP integration guide — how to add MCP tools to each agent role, what permissions each role needs, security surface
- External Agent Gateway role definition — a lightweight broker agent that validates incoming A2A requests before they touch the pipeline
- A2A watch notes — revisit when adoption signal is clearer
**Defer:** Full A2A implementation until protocol stabilizes

## Priority 5 — Polish

### Spec-Kit Command Contract Parity **[PARTIAL]**
**What it is:** Command files (`.claude/commands/`) currently lack machine-readable frontmatter. Spec-kit's command format includes `handoffs:` and `scripts:` fields that enable automated contract validation — e.g., checking that `/plan` references an approved spec before executing.
**Current state:** All 6 command files exist (`spec`, `clarify`, `plan`, `tasks`, `implement`, `review`). Frontmatter contracts not yet added.
**What to add:**
- Frontmatter schema for command files — `description`, `requires`, `handoffs`, `produces`
- Update all 6 command files in `templates/commands/` to include frontmatter
- Coordinator skills update — teach it to validate command preconditions against frontmatter `requires` fields before dispatch
**References:** github/spec-kit command format (`github-spec-kit/templates/commands/specify.md`)

## Notes

- None of these require Python or code — all are markdown documentation, agent instruction files, and schema definitions
- A2A: monitor but don't build to yet
- Items marked [PARTIAL] have a head start from the speckit integration already done in this repo
