# Golden Sample: CSV Export for Invoice List

This folder contains a complete example of a feature run through the AI Dev Shop (speckit) pipeline. It serves two purposes:

1. **Onboarding** — shows what the pipeline produces at every stage, with real content rather than placeholder instructions
2. **Framework QA** — if the framework changes, this example should still be produceable by the agents using the current templates and skills

---

## Full Pipeline (speckit)

```
[CodeBase Analyzer] → [Migration Plan] → Spec → [Red-Team] → Architect (research → constitution check → ADR) → tasks.md → TDD → Programmer → TestRunner → Code Review (+Refactor) → Security → Done
```

`[...]` stages are optional. Observer runs alongside the pipeline throughout (not shown inline).

## Coverage in This Folder

| Pipeline Stage | Agent | Artifact | Included Here |
|---------------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Spec | Spec Agent | `feature.spec.md` | ✅ `feature.spec.md` |
| Red-Team | Red-Team Agent | findings report | ✅ `red-team-findings.md` |
| Architect | Architect Agent | research summary + `adr.md` | ✅ `adr.md` (research embedded) |
| Task generation | Coordinator | `tasks.md` | ✅ `tasks.md` |
| TDD | TDD Agent | `test-certification.md` | ✅ `test-certification.md` |
| Programmer | Programmer Agent | implementation files | ❌ codebase-specific |
| TestRunner | TestRunner Agent | pass/fail report | ❌ codebase-specific |
| Code Review | Code Review Agent | findings report | ❌ codebase-specific |
| Refactor | Refactor Agent | proposals | ❌ codebase-specific |
| Security | Security Agent | threat report | ❌ codebase-specific |
| CodeBase Analyzer | CodeBase Analyzer | `ANALYSIS-*.md` | ❌ pre-pipeline, codebase-specific |
| Observer | Observer Agent | memory-store entries, scorecard | ❌ per-project, ongoing |

The pre-implementation artifacts (Spec through TDD certification) are the framework's primary value — they are what agents produce consistently regardless of target stack. Post-implementation stages depend on what the Programmer actually wrote, so they cannot be usefully templated here.

## What This Example Covers

Feature: a user can export the currently visible invoice list as a CSV file.

Deliberately small and realistic — small enough to understand end-to-end, large enough that the spec decisions, Red-Team findings, architecture tradeoffs, and test cases are non-trivial.

## How to Use This as a Reference

**When writing a spec:** compare against `feature.spec.md`. Every requirement should be observable and testable. Zero `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers at dispatch. Constitution Compliance table filled in.

**When reading Red-Team output:** compare against `red-team-findings.md`. Findings are BLOCKING, ADVISORY, or CONSTITUTION-FLAG. Only BLOCKING findings halt Architect dispatch.

**When writing an ADR:** compare against `adr.md`. Constitution Check table must come first, before any architecture content. Complexity Justification table must be present even if empty. Research summary is required when technology choices exist.

**When generating tasks:** compare against `tasks.md`. Tasks are phased by AC priority. `[P]` marks independent tasks. Checkpoints appear after Phase 1 and each story.

**When certifying tests:** compare against `test-certification.md`. Every AC, invariant, and edge case in the spec must have a corresponding test. The spec hash in the certification must match exactly.

## Known Simplifications

- Uses a fictional invoicing application — adapt field names and domain to your project
- ADR assumes TypeScript React frontend — adapt library choices to your stack
- Test certification uses Jest + React Testing Library — adapt to your test framework
