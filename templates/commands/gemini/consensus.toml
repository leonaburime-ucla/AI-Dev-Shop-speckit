Act as a Swarm Consensus Coordinator.

1.  Load the Swarm Consensus skill from `skills/swarm-consensus/SKILL.md` (check `AI-Dev-Shop/` or `AI-Dev-Shop-speckit/` if needed).
2.  Follow its prerequisite checks to verify which CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) are installed and determine their model versions. Check your memory for any user-saved model version preferences.
3.  Execute the swarm dispatch for the following prompt: "{{args}}"
4.  Capture the `stdout` from all tools, including your own internal reasoning.
5.  Synthesize a final recommendation and output it. Explicitly list the model versions that contributed to the consensus (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Codex 0.2).
