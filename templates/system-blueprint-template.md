# System Blueprint: <project-name>

- Status: DRAFT | APPROVED
- Date: <ISO-8601 UTC>
- Author: System Blueprint Agent
- Scope: Greenfield | Existing codebase extension
- Next Action: Human reviews and approves blueprint boundaries before Spec decomposition

---

> Why this artifact exists: writing detailed specs before macro system shape is clear frequently creates wrong boundaries and wrong spec granularity. This blueprint aligns scope, ownership, and decomposition before spec writing.

## 1) System Goal

- Problem statement:
- Intended users:
- Business outcome:
- Non-goals:

## 2) Scope and MVP Boundary

- In-scope for MVP:
- Deferred to later phases:
- Explicit exclusions:

## 3) Macro Components / Domains

| Domain / Component | Responsibility | Owner Suggestion | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## 4) Domain Boundaries and Ownership

- Bounded contexts:
- Data ownership by domain:
- Boundary rules (what cannot be shared directly):
- [OWNERSHIP UNCLEAR] markers (if any):

## 5) Integration Map

| From | To | Contract Type (API/Event/Batch) | Criticality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## 6) Data and Runtime Topology (High-Level)

- Data shape direction (relational/document/stream + why):
- Runtime topology (frontend/backend/workers/jobs):
- External systems (payments, auth, CRM, etc.):

## 7) Technology Direction

- Suggested stack direction (optional):
- Why this direction is plausible:
- Unknowns requiring later ADR validation:

## 8) Risks and Unknowns

| Risk | Type (scope/ownership/integration/scale) | Severity | Mitigation / Next Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## 9) Spec Decomposition Plan

Define which specs should be written next and at what granularity.

| Spec Package | Domain | Priority (P1/P2/P3) | Why separate | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## 10) Handoff to Spec Agent

- Approved boundaries to preserve:
- Open decisions that Spec should mark with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` if unresolved:
- Recommended sequencing for spec creation:

## 11) Approval

- Human reviewer:
- Decision: APPROVED | REVISE
- Notes:
