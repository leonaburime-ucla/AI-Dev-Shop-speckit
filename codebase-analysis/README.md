# codebase-analysis/

This folder holds reports generated by the **CodeBase Analyzer Agent** when analyzing an existing codebase before starting pipeline work.

**What lives here:**
- `ANALYSIS-*.md` — structured findings reports: architectural flaws, coupling issues, missing abstractions, test coverage gaps, security surface flags
- `MIGRATION-*.md` — phase-by-phase migration plans mapping findings to a target clean architecture

**Nothing here is source code or specs.** These are diagnostic reports about the weaknesses of the codebase you dropped AI Dev Shop into.

To generate a report: ask the CodeBase Analyzer Agent to analyze your project root.
To use a report: ask the CodeBase Analyzer Agent to produce a migration plan, or pass the report to the Architect Agent as context when writing the first ADR.
