# Startup Reminders

Tracks which one-time setup prompts the Coordinator has been asked not to show again.

The Coordinator reads this file on every startup and skips any reminder listed under Dismissed.

To re-enable a reminder, tell the Coordinator:
> "re-enable reminder: <name>"

The Coordinator will remove it from the Dismissed list and it will show on next startup.
You can also delete the line manually.
