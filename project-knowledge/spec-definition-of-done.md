# Spec Definition of Done

- Version: 1.0.0
- Last Updated: 2026-02-23
- Authority: A spec is INVALID and MUST NOT advance past the Spec Agent unless it passes every gate in this document. The Coordinator enforces this before dispatching the Architect Agent.

---

## Gate 0 — Implementation-Readiness Test (Applied Last, Enforced First)

Before marking any spec Done, apply this single test:

> **"Can a new developer — who has never spoken to anyone on this project — implement this feature correctly from these spec files alone, with no additional questions?"**

If the answer is NO for any reason, the spec is NOT done. Identify the gap, return to the Spec Agent, and fix it. This gate supersedes all checklist items below: a spec that passes every checklist item but fails this test is still invalid.

---

## Required Spec Package Files

A complete spec for feature `NNN-feature-name` requires ALL of the following files to exist and be non-empty before the spec is considered Done. Missing any single file is a blocking deficiency.

| File | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `feature.spec.md` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Human-readable spec: problem, scope, requirements, ACs, invariants, edge cases, dependencies, open questions, constitution compliance |
| `api.spec.ts` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | TypeScript-typed API contracts: request/response schemas, HTTP methods, status codes, error payloads |
| `state.spec.ts` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | TypeScript-typed state shapes: before/after for every mutation, initial state, derived state |
| `orchestrator.spec.ts` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Typed orchestration contracts: which services/repos are called, in what order, what they return, what errors they surface |
| `ui.spec.ts` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Typed UI contracts: component props, events emitted, loading/error/empty states, accessibility requirements |
| `errors.spec.ts` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Exhaustive error catalog: every error code, exact payload shape, HTTP status, user-facing message, retry behavior |
| `behavior.spec.md` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Deterministic behavior rules: precedence, ordering, defaults, limits, deduplication, tie-break logic — anything not expressible in types |
| `traceability.spec.md` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/` | Traceability matrix: REQ-* to function/component, REQ-* to test IDs |
| `checklists/spec-dod.md` | `specs/NNN-feature-name/checklists/` | This DoD checklist, completed with pass/fail status for this spec |

The existing `spec.md` (from `spec-template.md`) is renamed to `feature.spec.md` or kept as `spec.md` — either is valid as long as the file contains all required sections. The typed contract files (`api.spec.ts`, `state.spec.ts`, etc.) are additive and required in addition to it.

---

## Required Metadata Fields

Every spec package must carry the following metadata in `feature.spec.md`. Missing or placeholder values are a blocking deficiency.

| Field | Format | Valid Values | Invalid Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec_id` | `SPEC-NNN` | `SPEC-001`, `SPEC-042` | `SPEC-?`, `TBD`, empty |
| `version` | semver `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | `1.0.0`, `2.3.1` | `v1`, `draft`, empty |
| `status` | enum | `DRAFT`, `REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `SUPERSEDED` | `WIP`, `done`, free text |
| `content_hash` | `sha256:<64 hex chars>` | Computed from file contents below the metadata block | `TBD`, `pending`, stale hash |

The content hash MUST be recomputed every time any content below the metadata block changes. A stale hash is treated as a spec integrity violation (Constitution Article VII).

---

## Typed I/O Contracts (api.spec.ts)

`api.spec.ts` is not done until ALL of the following are present for every endpoint or external interface this feature exposes or consumes.

### Per Endpoint

- HTTP method, path, and path parameters — typed
- Request body schema — typed as a TypeScript interface or type alias; no `any`, no `unknown` without an explicit narrowing strategy documented in a comment
- Response body schema for every HTTP status code this endpoint can return — typed
- Query parameter schema — typed; required vs optional explicit
- Header requirements (auth headers, content-type, correlation IDs) — documented as inline comments

### Example

```typescript
// POST /api/v1/cart/items
export interface AddCartItemRequest {
  productId: string;   // UUID v4
  quantity: number;    // 1–99 inclusive
  variantId?: string;  // UUID v4; omit for products with no variants
}

export interface AddCartItemResponse {
  cartId: string;        // UUID v4
  itemId: string;        // UUID v4
  totalItems: number;    // count of distinct line items
  totalPrice: Money;
  updatedAt: string;     // ISO-8601 UTC
}

// HTTP 200: AddCartItemResponse
// HTTP 400: ErrorPayload (see errors.spec.ts) — CART_ITEM_INVALID_QUANTITY, CART_ITEM_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND
// HTTP 409: ErrorPayload — CART_ITEM_DUPLICATE
// HTTP 422: ErrorPayload — CART_ITEM_EXCEEDS_STOCK
// HTTP 500: ErrorPayload — INTERNAL_ERROR
```

### What Is NOT Acceptable

- "Returns a cart object" — not a typed contract
- `response: object` — no type information
- Missing error status codes — if the implementation can return a 409, the spec must define it
- Schemas described only in prose — prose descriptions in `feature.spec.md` are supplementary; the `.spec.ts` file is the authoritative typed contract

---

## Typed State Contracts (state.spec.ts)

`state.spec.ts` is not done until ALL of the following are present.

- Initial state shape — typed
- Every possible state transition — documented as before/after snapshots with typed shapes
- Derived state (computed values) — typed and documented with the derivation rule
- State invariants — enforced constraints typed and commented (e.g., "items.length === 0 implies totalPrice === 0")

### Example

```typescript
// Initial state
export interface CartState {
  cartId: string | null;
  items: CartItem[];
  totalPrice: Money;
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'error';
  lastError: ErrorPayload | null;
}

export const CART_INITIAL_STATE: CartState = {
  cartId: null,
  items: [],
  totalPrice: { amount: 0, currency: 'USD' },
  status: 'idle',
  lastError: null,
};

// State after addItem succeeds
// Before: { items: [], totalPrice: { amount: 0, currency: 'USD' } }
// After:  { items: [{ itemId, productId, quantity, unitPrice }], totalPrice: { amount: unitPrice * quantity, currency } }
// Invariant: totalPrice.amount === sum(items.map(i => i.unitPrice.amount * i.quantity))
```

---

## Typed Orchestrator Contracts (orchestrator.spec.ts)

`orchestrator.spec.ts` is not done until the following are specified for every use-case or orchestration flow in the feature.

- The services or repositories called, in order — typed as method signatures
- What each call receives — typed
- What each call returns on success — typed
- What each call returns on failure — typed (use the error catalog from `errors.spec.ts`)
- Conditional branching — documented with the condition and both branches
- Transaction boundaries — explicitly annotated (what is atomic, what is compensating)

### Example

```typescript
// AddCartItemOrchestrator
// 1. CartRepository.findOrCreate({ userId }) → CartEntity | CART_CREATE_FAILED
// 2. ProductRepository.findById({ productId }) → ProductEntity | CART_ITEM_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND
// 3. if (product.stock < quantity) → throw CART_ITEM_EXCEEDS_STOCK
// 4. CartRepository.addItem({ cartId, productId, quantity, variantId? }) → CartItemEntity | CART_ITEM_DUPLICATE
// 5. PriceCalculationService.recalculate({ cartId }) → Money | PRICE_CALCULATION_FAILED
// 6. CartRepository.save({ cartId, updatedAt: now() }) → void | CART_SAVE_FAILED
// Steps 4–6 are atomic. If any fail, compensate by calling CartRepository.removeItem({ cartId, itemId }).
```

---

## Error Codes and Payloads (errors.spec.ts)

`errors.spec.ts` is not done until EVERY error the feature can produce is cataloged with ALL of the following fields.

| Field | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Error code constant | Yes | `CART_ITEM_INVALID_QUANTITY` |
| HTTP status code | Yes | `400` |
| User-facing message | Yes — literal string, not a description | `"Quantity must be between 1 and 99."` |
| Machine-readable payload type | Yes — typed interface | `{ code: string; message: string; field?: string }` |
| Retry behavior | Yes — one of: `no-retry`, `retry-safe`, `retry-idempotent` | `no-retry` |
| Recovery action | Yes — what the client should do | `"Re-submit with quantity between 1 and 99."` |

### Example

```typescript
export const CART_ERRORS = {
  CART_ITEM_INVALID_QUANTITY: {
    httpStatus: 400,
    message: 'Quantity must be between 1 and 99.',
    field: 'quantity',
    retry: 'no-retry',
    recovery: 'Re-submit with a quantity value between 1 and 99.',
  },
  CART_ITEM_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND: {
    httpStatus: 400,
    message: 'The requested product does not exist.',
    field: 'productId',
    retry: 'no-retry',
    recovery: 'Verify the productId and re-submit.',
  },
  CART_ITEM_EXCEEDS_STOCK: {
    httpStatus: 422,
    message: 'Requested quantity exceeds available stock.',
    field: 'quantity',
    retry: 'retry-safe',
    recovery: 'Reduce quantity or wait for stock to replenish.',
  },
  CART_ITEM_DUPLICATE: {
    httpStatus: 409,
    message: 'This item is already in your cart.',
    field: 'productId',
    retry: 'no-retry',
    recovery: 'Use the update-quantity endpoint to change quantity for an existing item.',
  },
} as const;

export type CartErrorCode = keyof typeof CART_ERRORS;
export interface ErrorPayload {
  code: CartErrorCode;
  message: string;
  field?: string;
  traceId?: string;
}
```

---

## Deterministic Behavior Rules (behavior.spec.md)

`behavior.spec.md` is not done until EVERY behavior rule that cannot be expressed as a type is written as an explicit, testable rule. Vague prose is a blocking deficiency.

Required sections:

### Precedence Rules
When two rules conflict, which one wins? Document for every conflict point.
Example: "If both a percentage discount and a fixed-amount discount apply, the percentage discount is applied first, then the fixed-amount discount is applied to the discounted total."

### Ordering Rules
When order matters, what determines it? Document the sort key, tie-break key, and stability guarantees.
Example: "Cart items are displayed in insertion order. Insertion order is determined by `addedAt` ascending. If two items share the same `addedAt` millisecond (unlikely but possible in bulk-add flows), tie-break by `productId` ascending."

### Default Values
Every field with a default must state the default explicitly.
Example: "If `variantId` is omitted, the item is treated as a non-variant product. The stored `variantId` is `null`. The system does not infer a default variant."

### Limits and Caps
Every numeric limit must state: the limit, what happens when it is exceeded, and whether the limit is enforced at the API layer, service layer, or both.
Example: "Maximum 50 distinct line items per cart. Enforced at the service layer before persistence. Exceeding returns `CART_ITEM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (HTTP 422). The API layer does not pre-validate this limit."

### Deduplication Rules
When is a duplicate detected? What is the identity key? What happens to duplicates?
Example: "A cart item is a duplicate if `(cartId, productId, variantId)` already exists. Duplicate detection occurs in the service layer, not the database. Duplicates return `CART_ITEM_DUPLICATE` (HTTP 409). They do not silently merge."

### Tie-Break Logic
For any operation that could produce non-deterministic results, define the tie-break.
Example: "When multiple promotions are eligible, apply in ascending order of `promotion_id` (lexicographic). This is deterministic and auditable."

---

## Acceptance Scenarios

Every acceptance criterion (AC-NN) in `feature.spec.md` must have at least one acceptance scenario in this format. Acceptance scenarios are NOT the same as test cases — they define the exact expected observable output for a concrete input. They do not describe "what should happen in general."

### Required Format

```
Scenario: <AC-NN> — <short name>
Given:
  - <concrete precondition with exact values — not "a valid cart" but "cart C1 containing 2 units of product P1">
  - <additional preconditions>
When:
  - <exact action with exact inputs — not "user adds an item" but "POST /api/v1/cart/items with { productId: 'P2', quantity: 3 }">
Then:
  - <exact expected output — not "returns success" but "HTTP 200 with body { cartId: 'C1', itemId: <new UUID>, totalItems: 2, totalPrice: { amount: 2950, currency: 'USD' } }">
  - <side effects — e.g., "CartUpdated event emitted with payload { cartId: 'C1', updatedAt: <timestamp> }">
  - <state after — e.g., "Cart C1 now contains 2 line items">
```

### What Is NOT an Acceptance Scenario

- "When the user adds an item, they see the cart updated." — no concrete inputs, no exact outputs.
- "Returns a 200 with cart data." — "cart data" is not a defined output.
- "The state is updated correctly." — "correctly" is a vague qualifier (see Banned Language below).

---

## Traceability Matrix (traceability.spec.md)

`traceability.spec.md` is not done until every requirement and every function or component has a two-way mapping.

### Required Tables

**Table 1: REQ-* to Implementation**

| Requirement ID | Function / Component | File Path |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-01 | `CartService.addItem()` | `src/cart/cart.service.ts` |
| REQ-01 | `AddCartItemHandler` (HTTP handler) | `src/cart/cart.controller.ts` |
| REQ-02 | `CartRepository.findOrCreate()` | `src/cart/cart.repository.ts` |

**Table 2: REQ-* to Tests**

| Requirement ID | Test ID | Test File |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-01 | `AC-01-add-item-success` | `tests/cart/add-item.integration.test.ts` |
| REQ-01 | `AC-02-add-item-duplicate` | `tests/cart/add-item.integration.test.ts` |
| REQ-02 | `AC-03-cart-created-on-first-add` | `tests/cart/cart-creation.integration.test.ts` |

**Completeness rules:**
- Every REQ-* must appear in Table 1. A requirement with no implementation mapping is unimplemented.
- Every REQ-* must appear in Table 2. A requirement with no test mapping is untested.
- Every AC-NN must trace to at least one test ID. An AC with no test is untestable until mapped.
- The TDD Agent fills in Table 2 test IDs after producing tests. The Spec Agent fills Table 1 with the expected implementation targets. The Programmer Agent confirms Table 1 paths match actual implementation.

## Coordinator Blocking Conditions

The Coordinator MUST NOT dispatch the Architect Agent unless ALL of the following are true. Each condition is a hard gate — not a recommendation.

| # | Condition | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `feature.spec.md` exists and contains all required sections | File exists; all section headers present; no empty sections |
| 2 | `spec_id` is set and follows `SPEC-NNN` format | Metadata block parsed; regex match |
| 3 | `version` is set to valid semver | Metadata block parsed; semver regex match |
| 4 | `status` is `APPROVED` | Metadata block parsed; human has explicitly approved |
| 5 | `content_hash` is present and matches the current file content | Recompute sha256; compare to stored hash |
| 6 | Zero unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers in the spec | Grep the spec file for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`; count must be 0 |
| 7 | All required typed contract files exist and are non-empty | File system check for `api.spec.ts`, `state.spec.ts`, `orchestrator.spec.ts`, `ui.spec.ts`, `errors.spec.ts` |
| 8 | `behavior.spec.md` exists and all six required sections are present | File exists; section headers checked |
| 9 | `traceability.spec.md` exists with Table 1 populated | Every REQ-* has at least one implementation target |
| 10 | `checklists/spec-dod.md` exists and all items are marked PASS | No items marked FAIL or TODO |
| 11 | Constitution Compliance table in `feature.spec.md` is complete | Every article marked COMPLIES, EXCEPTION, or N/A; no blanks |
| 12 | Every EXCEPTION in the Constitution table has a justification noted | Justification column is non-empty for all EXCEPTION rows |
| 13 | Every acceptance scenario uses concrete inputs and exact expected outputs | Manual review; no vague qualifiers (see Banned Language section) |
| 14 | Red-Team Agent review completed with no BLOCKING findings unresolved | Red-Team report exists; BLOCKING count is 0 |
| 15 | Implementation-readiness test passes | New-developer test (Gate 0) passed by reviewer |

If any condition is false, the Coordinator MUST return the spec to the Spec Agent with a list of which conditions failed and why.

---

## Banned Vague Language

The following phrases are FORBIDDEN in any spec file unless they are immediately followed by a measurable criterion in the same sentence. Finding any of these phrases without a measurable criterion is a blocking deficiency.

| Banned Phrase | Why It Is Banned | Acceptable Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "should work" | Not testable. "Work" has no definition. | State the observable output for a specific input. |
| "remains unchanged" | Does not specify what is being checked or at what boundary. | List exactly which fields or state keys are unchanged and name the test that verifies it. |
| "consumer model only" | Does not define which model, which fields, or which exclusions. | List the exact fields included in the consumer view by name. |
| "handles gracefully" | "Gracefully" is subjective. | State the exact error code, HTTP status, user-facing message, and retry behavior. |
| "performs well" | No baseline, no metric, no measurement method. | State: p99 latency ≤ X ms under Y concurrent users measured by Z. |
| "is user-friendly" | Subjective. Not testable. | Describe the specific interaction and the observable outcome (e.g., "form field highlights in red and displays message 'Required'"). |
| "and so on" / "etc." | Indicates an incomplete enumeration. | Complete the list explicitly. If the list is unbounded, state the rule that governs it. |
| "as needed" | Does not define when the need arises or who decides. | State the triggering condition explicitly. |
| "reasonable" | Subjective. Not measurable. | Replace with the specific value or range. |
| "appropriate" | Subjective. Not measurable. | Replace with the specific criteria for what counts as appropriate. |
| "efficiently" | No baseline, no metric. | Replace with a measured latency, throughput, or resource budget. |
| "correctly" | "Correctly" has no definition without a spec. | Reference the AC or invariant that defines correct behavior. |
| "properly" | Same as "correctly". | Same fix as above. |
| "standard behavior" | Does not define which standard or which RFC. | Reference the standard explicitly (e.g., "per RFC 7231 Section 6.3.1"). |
| "best practices" | Not actionable. | Name the specific practice and cite the source. |
| "minimal impact" | No metric. | State the maximum acceptable degradation in measurable terms. |

**Enforcement:** The Spec Agent must grep for each of these phrases before declaring the spec Done. The Red-Team Agent includes banned-language checks in its review pass.
